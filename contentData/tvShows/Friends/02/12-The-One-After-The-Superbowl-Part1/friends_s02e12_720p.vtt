<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Can't get the monkey off your back?

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.180
<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Then put it in your mouth...

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.266
<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>...with Monkeyshine Beer!

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.104
<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Wow.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.985
<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Monkeyshine Beer.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.487
<v COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Because it's a jungle out there!

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.282
<v Ross>That commercial always
makes me so sad.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:38.912
<v Joey>Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him so everything works out okay.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.332
<v Ross>I meant because the monkey in it
reminds me of Marcel.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.709
<v Phoebe>I can see that.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:48.505
<v Phoebe>Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.383
<v Monica>And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Ross>I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.475
<v Rachel>Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:03.562
<v Rachel>I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will
no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Ross>Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.362
<v Ross>...and when you got it back,
there'd be little monkey raisins in it?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.825
<v Chandler>When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.455
<v Chandler>All of a sudden, I had
this big "attitude problem. "

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:11.839
<v Joey>Hey. Hey.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.675
<v Joey>- Check it out! Guess what I got?
- Rhythm?

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.886
<v Joey>No. My first fan mail!

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.471
<v Joey>Check it out.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.473
<v Monica>"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Monica>Know that I love you and
would do anything to have you. "

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.021
<v Monica>My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford. "

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:30.732
<v Monica>Oh, wait.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.404
<v Monica>"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes. "

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.992
<v Rachel>You know, in Crazy World,
that means you're married.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:45.873
<v Monica>It's not addressed to Days Of Our Lives.
This came to your apartment.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.667
<v Monica>There's no stamp on it.
This woman was in our building.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.252
<v Joey>Oh, my God.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.005
<v Joey>I got my very own stalker!

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.675
<v Ross>- Hey, guys.
Hey.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.177
<v Monica>Hey.
Ooh.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.428
<v Monica>Where are you off to?

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.306
<v Ross>There's this paleontology
conference in L.A.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:06.560
<v Ross>So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.105
<v Joey>I think he will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.484
<v Joey>...and, uh, you know,
isn't capable of that emotion.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.281
<v Rachel>Oh, Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.574
<v Phoebe>Oh? Oh.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:21.909
<v Phoebe>Okay, so everyone, ahem...

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.454
<v Phoebe>...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.039
<v Phoebe>So everyone just laugh. Now!

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.501
<v Phoebe>I know, I know! Oh.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Phoebe>- Hello.
- Hi.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:34.463
<v Rob>Oh.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:35.839
<v Rob>I'm Rob Donan.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.132
<v Phoebe>Hi, Rob Donan.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.595
<v Rob>I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.431
<v Phoebe>Oh, wow. Ha, ha.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.393
<v Rob>Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:53.315
<v Rob>And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.108
<v Phoebe>Oh, I would love to have kids...

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:02.366
<v Phoebe>...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.620
<v Joey>What do you wanna do for dinner?

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Chandler>We could stay in and cook for ourselves.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.922
<v Chandler>- Hello.
It's Erika.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Joey>Oh, my God. The stalker!

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:20.259
<v Erika>Never mind. It's open.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.302
<v Joey>Aah! Aah!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.347
<v Chandler>Yes, hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.351
<v Chandler>We might wanna have a backup plan,
though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.187
<v Joey>Let's get out of here!

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.858
<v Chandler>The one time they're not home!

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.694
<v Joey>Okay. Okay.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:40.779
<v Joey>We'll leave.
When we pass her...

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.699
<v Joey>...she won't know me,
because we never met!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.703
<v Chandler>That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.206
<v Joey>She's coming!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.297
<v Erika>It's me.
- Aah!

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:02.092
<v Joey>Uh, this is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.054
<v Joey>- You ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.563
<v Erika>Hi.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Joey>Erika!

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.534
<v Dean>Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.495
<v Dean>Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.456
<v Dean>I was told you had a question.

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:37.336
<v Ross>I, uh... I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.129
<v Ross>...answers to the name Marcel?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.924
<v Dean>Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.594
<v Dean>Marcel has passed on.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.931
<v Ross>Oh, my God. What happened?

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.726
<v Dean>Well, he got sick,
and then he got sicker...

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.978
<v Dean>...and then he got a little better.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.147
<v Dean>But then he died.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.109
<v Ross>I can't believe this!

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.114
<v Dean>I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.950
<v Dean>"Sometimes monkeys die. "

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.954
<v Dean>It's not a great saying...

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.333
<v Dean>...but it certainly is fitting today.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:19.461
<v Ross>- Someone should've called me.
I'm sorry.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.089
<v Dean>Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:24.716
<v Dean>...but here, it's just a gesture.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:27.844
<v Ross>Zoo dollars?

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:32.349
<v Dean>Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Dean> Well, it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.069
Ooh.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.779
<v Phoebe>I know.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.950
<v Monica>I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.701
<v Monica>What is she like?

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.371
<v Chandler>- Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery?
Mm-hm.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.707
<v Chandler>Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:06:59.918
<v Rachel>And she's not crazy?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.712
<v Chandler>Oh, no, no.
She's a total wack job.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.676
<v Chandler>Yeah. She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.261
<v Rachel>Oh, my God!

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.555
<v Monica>Oh. And he's going out with her?

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.432
<v Monica>He cannot pursue this.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.269
<v Chandler>Just because this woman thinks she can
see Joey through the magical box...

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.021
<v Chandler>...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.650
<v Chandler>Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.947
<v Chandler>What are you looking at me for?
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:31.116
<v Rob>Are you okay?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.452
<v Phoebe>No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.955
<v Phoebe>Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear...

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.083
<v Rob>That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Phoebe>Oh.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.130
<v Phoebe>Yeah.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.591
<v Phoebe>I'm used to playing for grownups.

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:51.303
<v Phoebe>Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing, you know.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.596
<v Phoebe>And kids...

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.055
<v Rob>...listen.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.059
<v Phoebe>It's just a huge responsibility.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.394
<v Phoebe>What?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Phoebe>Are you gonna kiss me?

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Rob>I was thinking about it.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.485
<v Phoebe>Okay.

00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:11.615
<v Phoebe>Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.952
<v Phoebe>Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.497
Hi, Phoebe!

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:20.999
<v Phoebe>Ha, ha. Okay. Um...

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:25.212
<v Phoebe>...I'm gonna play, um, some songs
about grandparents, okay?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.926
<v Phoebe>Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:34.179
<v Phoebe>She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.432
<v Phoebe>But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.936
<v Phoebe>And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:45.482
<v Phoebe>Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.985
<v Phoebe>But the truth is she died
And someday you will too

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:58.161
<v Phoebe>La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:02.916
<v Erika>- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.253
<v Joey>What?

00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:09.714
<v Erika>Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:14.302
<v Erika>...and just a little while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.804
<v Joey>Yeah, that was a tricky one.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.723
<v Joey>In reality...

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:23.061
<v Joey>...that operation takes over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for two minutes.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:24.854
<v Erika>Who's "they"?

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Joey>No one.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:34.656
<v Erika>Oh, Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.284
<v Erika>- Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.
- Ha, ha.

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.245
<v Erika>Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.746
<v Erika>- But I won't.
Ha, ha.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.124
<v Joey>Good.
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:52.007
<v Erika>No, seriously.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.676
<v Erika>These hands...

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.429
<v Erika>...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.725
<v Erika>Oh, just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:05.270
<v Joey>- All right. Ha, ha. Just one.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.154
<v Joey>Wow.

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:15.739
<v Joey>You're good at that.

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:20.327
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.579
Is anyone here a doctor?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.830
<v Erika>Oh, yes.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.832
<v Erika>Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.126
<v Erika>Dr. Drake Ramoray!

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:47.604
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:54.903
<v Ross>Uh, hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.947
<v Ross>But, um, zoo dollars?

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:01.576
It's about your monkey.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.745
It's alive.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:11.127
<v Erika>I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:14.631
<v Joey>Uh, because, uh,
I'm a neurosurgeon...

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.718
<v Joey>...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.095
<v Joey>..."foodal chokage. "

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:22.847
<v Joey>You know.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:28.061
<v Joey>- I gotta tell you something...
- No, no, no.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.105
<v Erika>You don't have to tell me anything.

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:32.649
<v Erika>You don't have
to explain yourself to me. Oh!

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.944
<v Erika>Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.196
<v Joey>- That's...
- I should be happy to be near you.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.489
<v Joey>Hey, I...

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.911
<v Erika>"Hey" what?

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.497
<v Joey>That's it. Just hey!

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.625
<v Joey>Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.255
<v Joey>Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Joey>Hey.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.218
<v Phoebe>There'll be times when you get older

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.053
<v Phoebe>When you'll want to sleep with people

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:05.515
<v Phoebe>Just to make them like you
But don't

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.851
<v Phoebe>'Cause

00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:11.479
<v Phoebe>That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:12.647
<v Phoebe>Everybody!

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:17.694
<v Phoebe>That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.030
<v Monica>- Excellent!
- Very informative!

00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:24.033
<v Rachel>Not at all inappropriate!

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:28.163
<v Phoebe>Thank you for coming, everybody.
There are cookies in the back.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.082
<v Rob>That was great.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Rob>The kids loved you.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.254
<v Phoebe>Yay! I rock!

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Rob>And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.676
<v Rob>Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.553
<v Rob>You were incredible!

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.889
<v Phoebe>Ha, ha. But?

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.809
<v Rob>- How did you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:52.145
<v Phoebe>It was either "but" or "butter. "

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.357
<v Rob>The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:58.234
<v Rob>...they were hoping that...

00:12:58.402 --> 00:13:01.362
<v Rob>...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.822
<v Phoebe>I can do that.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.115
<v Rob>- Really?
- Yeah.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:07.577
<v Rob>- Because that would be fantastic.
- Oh.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.705
<v Rob>What? You wanna kiss me?

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.582
<v Phoebe>I'm thinking about it.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.586
Ah, the bat.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.297
Ambassador of darkness.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:23.593
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.263
Sightless specter of the macabre.

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:29.766
<v Ross>Buddy, my monkey?

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.935
Oh, yeah, right.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.896
There was a break-in...

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.857
...a few months back. Inside job.

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.359
Your monkey was taken.

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.945
<v Ross>Oh, my God. The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.113
Pfft. The zoo!

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:46.825
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:52.831
<v Ross>Uh, that's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.376
Of course they'll say he's dead.
They don't want the bad publicity.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.002
It's all a great big cover-up.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.090
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.008
<v Ross>That guy Lipson?

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.094
Lipson knows?

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:07.846
Hmm.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.639
Lipson knows, huh?

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.058
Ah, hello, Mr. Possum.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:16.020
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.315
- Taunting gravity...
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.027
Word on the street...

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:27.532
Well, when I say "street," I mean
those little pretend streets here at the zoo.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.117
<v Ross>Of course.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.454
Your monkey found a new career...

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.041
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.919
<v Ross>This is unbelievable!

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:45.049
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.595
<v Ross>Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:50.305
Maybe.

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:54.183
<v Ross>But you already told me everything.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:05.612
<v Ross>Check it out. He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.822
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.326
<v Ross>I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find out where he is.

00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:14.454
<v Chandler>That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.998
<v Phoebe>Okay, hi again!

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.876
Hi, Phoebe!

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:24.672
<v Phoebe>Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.635
<v Phoebe>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.845
<v Phoebe>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:33.514
<v Phoebe>Then the farmer hits him on the head
And grinds him up

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.808
<v Phoebe>And that's how we get hamburgers

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:42.065
<v Phoebe>Now chickens

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.401
You're the only one who can save her, Drake!

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:48.321
Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God!

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.615
<v Ross>Well, there goes my whole belief system.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.160
<v Erika>It's Erika.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:55.870
<v Joey>Quick! Quick. Shut off the TV.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.956
<v Rachel>Wait, I wanna see what happens!

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Joey>Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.961
<v Rachel>How can that be?
You were just kissing Sabrina.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:07.090
<v Monica>Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:11.928
<v Joey>Hey, Erika. Come in.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.390
<v Monica>How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.726
<v Joey>Right, they, uh, choppered me in.
Ha, ha.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.353
<v Joey>What's up?

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.605
<v Erika>Oh, you're having a little party too.

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:25.149
<v Erika>- Is she here, huh, huh?
- Who?

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.485
<v Erika>Sabrina. I know about you two!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:30.822
<v Erika>I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.075
<v Joey>It's not what you think.
That was...

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.327
<v Erika>You told me I was the only one!

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.208
<v Joey>All right, look. That's it.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.419
<v Joey>We shouldn't see each other anymore.

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:46.546
<v Joey>I should have told you
a long time ago...

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.382
<v Joey>...but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.302
<v Joey>I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.723
<v Erika>Oh, my God. Do the people
at the hospital know about this?

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.395
<v Joey>Ha, ha.
Somebody wanna help me out here?

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.897
<v Rachel>Oh, I know! I know!

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.733
Where am I?

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.609
<v Joey>University Hospital...

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:11.446
<v Joey>...the same place you've been
for the last 18 years.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.615
<v Erika>How can you be here and there?

00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:16.909
<v Joey>Ha, ha.
Because it's a television show.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Erika>Drake, what are you getting at?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.207
<v Joey>I'm not Drake!

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.294
<v Ross>That's right. He's not Drake. He's...

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.255
<v Ross>...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.887
<v Erika>Is this true?

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.223
<v Rachel>Yes! Yes, it is true.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.225
<v Rachel>And I know this...

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.812
<v Rachel>...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.863
<v Rachel>And then he told me
he would run away with me.

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.448
<v Monica>And he didn't!

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.827
<v Chandler>And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.335
<v Erika>Is all this true?

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:14.425
<v Joey>Yes, I'm afraid it is.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.761
<v Joey>You deserve much better than me, Erika.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:21.474
<v Joey>You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.935
<v Joey>Go to Salem. Find him!

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.145
<v Joey>He's the guy for you.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.897
<v Erika>Oh, Hans.

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:31.943
<v Ross>Hans?

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.903
<v Ross>Hans!

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.697
<v Ross>Yo, evil twin!

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Joey>Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.203
<v Joey>Good luck in Salem.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.206
<v Joey>Take care.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Erika>I'll never forget you, Hans.

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:55.007
<v Joey>Ha, ha. All right.
The people who threw the water!

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:56.717
Helping you out!

00:18:56.927 --> 00:19:00.054
<v Phoebe>Fired? Why?

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:03.307
<v Rob>The library board has had
a lot of complaints from parents...

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:06.435
<v Rob>...about some of the stuff in your songs.
- I can't believe it!

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:10.606
<v Phoebe>Did you tell your board about how
the kids want to hear the truth?

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.442
<v Rob>No.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:16.946
<v Phoebe>I see.

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:21.075
<v Rob>Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddie songs?

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.577
<v Phoebe>No.

00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:24.704
<v Phoebe>What do you want me to be?
Like some...

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.916
<v Phoebe>...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.918
<v Rob>You don't have to be Barney.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.171
<v Phoebe>- Who's Barney?
- Eh...

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:41.554
<v Ross>Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this:
He's healthy, he's happy...

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:45.766
<v Ross>...and he's here in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:47.143
<v Rachel>You're kidding!

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.353
<v Chandler>- This is amazing.
- I know.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.982
<v Chandler>I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:56.152
<v Phoebe>Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.403
<v Rachel>Okay.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.285
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is who tells the truth?

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:07.455
<v Phoebe>Um, yeah, I guess that's me.

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:10.291
She's here!

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.594
<v Phoebe>Sometimes men love women

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.430
<v Phoebe>And sometimes men love men

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.058
<v Phoebe>And then there are bisexuals

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.311
<v Phoebe>Though some just say
They're kidding themselves

00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:34.607
<v Phoebe>La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.777
<v Phoebe>La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.032
<v Ross>This is exciting. I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.701
<v Chandler>What, you never
look down in the shower?

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:50.665
<v Chandler>Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make
one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.500
Back up, please.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.210
Back up. Come on, come on.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:57.004
<v Ross>Excuse me.
Uh, where can we find the monkey?

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:58.673
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.884
<v Ross>I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.387
<v Ross>We, uh, used to live together.

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:07.807
Yeah. And I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with Flipper.

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:11.811
<v Monica>Ross, there he is!

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.188
<v Ross>Hey! Hey, buddy!

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.983
<v Ross>Marcel! Marcel!

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:29.829
<v Ross>In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:39.630
<v Ross>In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.619
<v Phoebe>They won't take you to the vet

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:14.332
<v Phoebe>You're obviously not
Their favorite pet

00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:18.169
<v Phoebe>- Smelly cat, smelly cat
- Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:21.630
<v Phoebe>- It's not your fault
- It's not your fault

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.218
<v Rob>No

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.346
<v Phoebe>- Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry.
- What?

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:29.805
<v Rob>What's wrong with that?

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.226
<v Phoebe>Um, ahem, I think you might wanna,
like, pick a more masculine note. Heh.

1
00:00:00.323  --> 00:00:02.950
<v Monica>I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker.

2
00:00:03.118  --> 00:00:04.701
<v Monica>What is she like?

3
00:00:04.869  --> 00:00:07.371
<v Chandler>Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery?
<v Monica>Mm-hm.

4
00:00:07.539  --> 00:00:10.707
<v Chandler>Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

5
00:00:11.793  --> 00:00:12.918
<v Rachel>And she's not crazy?

6
00:00:13.086  --> 00:00:15.712
<v Chandler>Oh, no, no.
She's a total wack job.

7
00:00:15.880  --> 00:00:20.676
<v Chandler>Yeah. She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

8
00:00:20.844  --> 00:00:22.261
<v Rachel>Oh, my God!

9
00:00:22.429  --> 00:00:24.555
<v Monica>Oh. And he's going out with her?

10
00:00:24.764  --> 00:00:26.432
<v Monica>He cannot pursue this.

11
00:00:26.599  --> 00:00:30.269
<v Chandler>Just because this woman thinks she can
see Joey through the magical box...

12
00:00:30.437  --> 00:00:33.021
<v Chandler>...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

13
00:00:33.189  --> 00:00:36.650
<v Chandler>Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

14
00:00:37.694  --> 00:00:41.947
<v Chandler>What are you looking at me for?
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
